# Frontend
This frontend repository goes over the foundation of the Cloud Resume Challenge, which is hosting a resume on a static website using a cloud software, in this case AWS S3. By deploying a file with HTML and CSS, the resume is handled through code through HTML's structure and CSS's style. This was uploaded to the S3 bucket, and using AWS CloudFront, Certificate Manager, Namecheap, and Route53, was deployed to my [website](https://www.aelikim.com). 

###HTML and CSS

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was a coding language used to create the structure of my cloud resume challenge. This serves as the backbone of websites, and dictates what will be displayed on a webpage. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), similarly to HTML, dictates the display of a web page, but handles more of the presentation and style. In the case of my [website](https://www.aelikim.com), CSS handles the styling of the text, size, and alignment of my text, while HTML decides the actual structure. The full html file for my resume can be found within this repository, under the name index.html.
